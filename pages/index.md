## Background

The Office of Management and Budget is accepting public comment on draft guidance to improve the acquisition and management of enterprise software. This policy is the second in a series of [category management]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/simplifying-federal-procurement-to-improve-performance-drive-innovation-increase-savings.pdf) policies to drive greater performance, efficiencies, and savings in commonly-purchased information technology goods and services. The first memo in the series, [M-16-02](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m-16-02.pdf), addressed the acquisition of laptops and desktops.  

The proposed guidance is now open for public comment on this page. The public feedback period will be 30 days, starting on December 21, 2015, and closing on January 20, 2016. Following the public feedback period, OMB will analyze all submitted feedback and revise the policy as necessary.
